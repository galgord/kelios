> We build the software your business actually needs. Custom internal tools that solve your specific problems delivered in weeks, not months.

## About Us

Craftsman by Kelios is a custom software development company founded by Gal Gordon and Roger Fuentes two mobile engineers with 25 years of combined experience in tech. We previously worked together and noticed that businesses were using AI and no-code tools to get 90% of the way there but couldn't cross the finish line. So we started Craftsman to help businesses get to 100%.

We've built software for luxury real estate tech, sports tech, and fintech. We're based in Latin America and work with businesses across the Americas and beyond.

Our philosophy: Too many people stick to what they know because they're scared to let technology make their lives easier. We're here to change that.
